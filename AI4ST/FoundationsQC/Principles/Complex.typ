In mathematics, a *complex number* is an element of a number system that
extends the real numbers with a specific element denoted $i$, called the
*imaginary unit* and satisfying the equation $i^(2) = - 1$. The set of
complex numbers is denoted by the symbol $CC$.

Every complex number $z$ can be expressed in the form $a + b i$, where
$a$ and $b$ are real numbers and are referred to as its *real part* and
its *imaginary part*, respectively. The real part of a complex number
$z$ is denoted $Re(z)$, the imaginary part $Im(z)$. A complex number
with imaginary part equal to $0$ is simply a real number; a complex
number with real part equal to $0$ is said to be a *purely imaginary*
number.

Addition, subtraction and multiplication of complex numbers can be
naturally defined by using the rule $i^(2) = âˆ’1$ along with the
associative, commutative, and distributive laws.

A complex number $z$ can be identified with the ordered pair of real
numbers $(Re(z), Im(z))$, which may be interpreted as coordinates of
a point in a Euclidean plane with standard coordinates, which is then
called the *complex plane* or *Argand diagram*. The horizontal axis is
generally used to display the real part, with increasing values to the
right, and the imaginary part marks the vertical axis, with increasing
values upwards.

Given a complex number $z = a + i b$, the *complex conjugate* of $z$ is
the number $z^(*) = a - i b$, obtained by changing the sign of the imaginary
part of $z$. Geometrically, $z$ is the "reflection" of $z$ about the real
axis. It is trivial to see that, for any complex number $z$, $(z^(*))^(*)
= z$. A complex number is real if and only if it equals its own conjugate.

The square root of the product between a complex number $z$ and its
complex conjugate $z^(*)$ is a non negative real number called *modulus*
or *magnitude*:

$ abs(z) =
  sqrt(z dot z^(*)) =
  sqrt((Re(z) + i Im(z))(Re(z) - i Im(z))) =
  sqrt(Re(z)^(2) + Im(z)^(2)) $

By Pythagoras' theorem, $abs(z)$ is the distance from the origin to
the point representing the complex number $z$ in the complex plane.

The *argument* of $z$ (sometimes called the "phase" $phi$), denoted as
$arg(z)$, is the angle formed by the vector $(Re(z), Im(z))$ with the
positive real axis in the complex plane:

$ arg(z) = tan^(-1) (frac(Im(z), Re(z))) $

Note that any rotation of $2 k pi$ with $k in ZZ$ is equivalent to
performing no rotation at all, therefore the argument is often required
to be specified in the interval $(-pi, pi]$.

A complex number $z = a + i b$ is said to be written in *rectangular form*, 
or *algebraic form*. Another way to express a complex number is the *polar
form*; given a complex number $z$ with modulus $r = abs(z)$ and argument
$phi = arg(z)$, the polar form of $z$ is:

$ z = r(cos(phi) + i sin(phi)) $

A third way to express complex numbers is the *exponential form*:

$ z = r e^(i phi) $

Where the complex exponential $e^(i phi)$ is also referred to as the *phase
factor*.

The *conjugate transpose* of a matrix $A$, denoted as $A^(dagger)$, is the
matrix obtained from transposing $A$ and then applying complex conjugation
to each element of the resulting matrix:

$ A^(dagger) = A^(T^(*)) =
  mat(a_(1, 1), a_(1, 2), dots, a_(1, n);
      a_(2, 1), a_(2, 2), dots, a_(2, n);
      dots.v, dots.v, dots.down, dots.v;
      a_(m, 1), a_(m, 2), dots, a_(m, n))^(T^(*)) =
  mat(a_(1, 1)^(*), a_(2, 1)^(*), dots, a_(m, 1)^(*);
      a_(1, 2)^(*), a_(2, 2)^(*), dots, a_(m, 2)^(*);
      dots.v, dots.v, dots.down, dots.v;
      a_(1, n)^(*), a_(2, n)^(*), dots, a_(m, n)^(*)) $

#exercise[
  What is the conjugate transpose of the following matrix?

  $ A = mat(1, -2 - i, 5;
            1 + i, i, 4 - 2i) $
]
#solution[

  $ A^(dagger) =
    mat(1, -2 - i, 5;
        1 + i, i, 4 - 2i)^(dagger) =
    mat(1, 1 + i;
        -2 - i, i;
        5, 4 - 2i)^(*) =
    mat(1, 1 - i;
        -2 + i, -i;
        5, 4 + 2i) $
]

A square matrix $A$ is said to be *Hermitian* if $A^(dagger) = A$. It
is said to be *unitary* if $A^(dagger) = A^(-1)$.

Any matrix is equivalent to an operator given a fixed basis and vice
versa, therefore it is also possible to define the conjugate transpose
of an operator. Since trasposing an operator in matrix form exchanges
domain and codomain, the conjugate transpose of an operator $O: V -> W$
is the operator $O^(dagger): W -> V$. The matrix representation of
$O^(dagger)$ is, as expected, the conjugate transpose of the matrix
representation of $O$.

The conjugate transpose of an operator is also called its *adjoint operator*.
If an operator is equal to its adjoint (or equivalently, if its matrix
representation is Hermitian), it is said to be *self-adjoint*. 

The fourth way to express a complex number is the *matrix form*. Given a 
complex number $z = a + i b$, it can be written as a $2 times 2$ matrix
as follows:

$ a + i b = mat(a, -b; b, a) $

The complex conjugate of a complex number in matrix form is simply its
matrix transpose.

It is also possible to transition immediately from the exponential form to
the matrix form:

$ r e^(i phi) = r mat(cos(theta), -sin(theta); sin(theta), cos(theta)) =
  r cos(theta) mat(1, 0; 0, 1) + r sin(theta) mat(0, -1; 1, 0) $

Which also means that the real unit and the imaginary unit are simply:

#grid(
  columns: (0.5fr, 0.5fr),
  [$ 1 = mat(1, 0; 0, 1) $],
  [$ i = mat(0, -1; 1, 0) $]
)

This representation is consistent with respect to standard complex number
operations. For example, to show that $z z^(*) = a^(2) + b^(2)$:

$ z z^(*) &=
  mat(a, -b; b, a) mat(a, -b; b, a)^(T) =
  mat(a, -b; b, a) mat(a, b; -b, a) =
  mat(a a + (-b)(-b), a b + (-b)a; b a + a (-b), b b + a a) =
  mat(a^(2) + b^(2), cancel(a b) - cancel(a b);
      cancel(a b) - cancel(a b), a^(2) + b^(2)) = \
  &= mat(a^(2) + b^(2), 0; 0, a^(2) + b^(2))
  = (a^(2) + b^(2)) mat(1, 0; 0, 1)
  = a^(2) + b^(2) $

The inverse of a matrix representing a complex number is the reciprocal of
the number itself. Given a complex number $z = mat(a, -b; b, a)$:

$ mat(a, -b; b, a)^(-1) = frac(1, a^(2) + b^(2)) mat(a, b; -b, a) = 
  frac(cancel(z^(*)), z cancel(z^(*))) = frac(1, z) $
